The hashtag [#CreateAnywhere](https://twitter.com/hashtag/createanywhere) takes on greater meaning now that [**Paper by FiftyThree**](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) is available for iPhone --- a device I *always have with me*. Not only that but with a new set of tricks up its sleeve, Paper is quickly becoming a productivity powerhouse.

Here's some of my favorite additions found in the 3.0 update...

{% include toc.html %}

## Universal Paper App

Yes, you've read correctly --- Paper is now a universal iOS app that works on both iPad and iPhone. Every time I open Paper on my iPhone 5s I'm amazed all of the features found on the iPad version made the journey over. Much like the complete UI overhaul in [version 1.6.1](http://news.fiftythree.com/post/79379441335/the-paper-ios-7-update-is-here-brighter-fresher), I got the sense that the team at FiftyThree re-evaluated every bit of the app for 3.0. Even if that meant modifying a few of Paper's defining characteristics[^changes] in order to make the overall experience more intuitive and fluid.

[^changes]: Yes the journal book view and zoom loupe have gone away. Change is good, deal with it {% icon deal-with-it %}.

## Importing Images

Love it or hate it (stick me in the love it camp), you can finally import images into Paper by FiftyThree! Tap the camera icon and you can either snap a picture or choose one from your photo library to place on the canvas.

Currently you are limited to one photo per idea --- but you can scale it, rotate it, and even call-out an area of interest with a new [*Spotlight option*](http://blog.fiftythree.com/posts/annotate-spotlight-photos).

I'm excited to use this feature as a sketching aid --- drawing directly on reference images I've imported into Paper. There's no way to toggle this layer off yet (*psst... FiftyThree engineers if you're reading*), but it's easy enough to remove if you want to leave behind just what you've drawn or painted.

## Rotating Ideas

What a time saver this one is. If you wanted to share ideas "right side up" you had to export to the camera roll to make the rotation edit. This worked OK for sharing on social media but not so much with drawings shared on Mix --- you just had to live with them displaying horizontally.

In 3.0 there's a new button conveniently located below each idea for rotating the canvas in 90 degree intervals. Horizontal and vertical ideas live in harmony together because of the new grid view. Which leads me to my next favorite thing in Paper 3.0...

## Journals Replaced with "Spaces"

Paging through Paper's digital journals might have been a good idea years ago, but with page counts in the hundreds it quickly becomes unusable. Journals transitioning into "Spaces" is one of the best things to happen to Paper since the introduction of [**Think Kit**](https://www.fiftythree.com/think).
